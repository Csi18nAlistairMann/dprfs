- A bug whereby a populated directory moved into a second sees the orginal
content vanish in the gdrive but not the rdrive.
    To replicate:
	1. mkdir "initial"
	2. echo "cobblers" >"initial/testfile"
	3. cat "initial/testfile" should show "cobblers"
	4. mkdir "second"
	5. mv initial second
	6. ls second/initial/ should show file but actually shows empty
- Unit tests are inexhaustive
