Notice that the points-to path and filename is unquoted. The code will
trim at left to the first character right of the equals sign, and at
right to the first non-whitespace character. Thus, no need to quote
even though it has a space in the middle. This does mean no spaces
allowed at right of filename. Does anyone do this though?
